⚠️ Both need **doctor prescription and monitoring**. Do not take on your own.




Nebicard 5 (nebivolol 5 mg) is used mainly to **treat high blood pressure (hypertension)**.

It is also used for:

* **Heart failure** (mild to moderate)
* **Reducing heart rate**
* **Preventing heart-related complications** like stroke or heart attack

It works by **slowing the heart rate and relaxing blood vessels**, which lowers blood pressure.






If your blood pressure is **low (hypotension)**, you should **talk to a doctor first** before taking anything.

For low BP, doctors *sometimes* use medications like:

* **Midodrine**
* **Fludrocortisone**

Also simple measures help raise BP:

* **More salt (if doctor approves)**
* **Drink more water**
* **Compression stockings**
* **Small frequent meals**




**Midodrine**
Used to **raise low blood pressure**, especially **orthostatic hypotension** (BP drops when standing). It tightens blood vessels.

**Fludrocortisone**
Used to **increase blood volume** by retaining salt and water. Helps in **chronic low BP** and **adrenal insufficiency**.




** dangerous.**

If a person already has **normal or high blood pressure**, taking **Midodrine or Fludrocortisone can cause:**

* **Severe high BP**
* **Stroke or heart attack**
* **Heart failure**
* **Severe headache, chest pain**
* **Low potassium (Fludrocortisone)**

⚠️ **Never use these if BP is normal/high. Doctor must confirm true low BP first.**



**Only doctor decides dose. General info:**

**Midodrine**

* Usual start: **2.5 mg, 2–3 times/day**
* Common dose: **5–10 mg, 3 times/day**
* Max: **30 mg/day**
* ❌ Not at night (can cause high BP while lying)

**Fludrocortisone**

* Usual dose: **0.1 mg once/day**
* Sometimes up to **0.2 mg/day**
* Needs BP, potassium monitoring

⚠️ **Self-medication is unsafe. Cause of low BP must be known first.**


Understood. **For study only.** Short and clear.

If a **normal person takes Midodrine + Fludrocortisone** and BP rises:

**What happens**

* Midodrine → BP rises fast (30–60 min)
* Fludrocortisone → fluid overload, high BP (hours–days)

**Danger signs**

* Severe headache
* Chest pain
* Very high BP
* Fast/irregular heartbeat
* Breathlessness
* Blurred vision

**How to act / save**

1. **Stop the medicines immediately**
2. **Lay person down, head elevated**
3. **Do NOT give salt or fluids**
4. **Check BP repeatedly**
5. **Go to hospital / ER immediately**
6. Doctors may give:

   * BP-lowering drugs
   * Diuretics
   * Potassium correction
   * Heart monitoring (ECG)

**Key point**
There is **no home treatment** if BP spikes. Only **medical care** prevents heart attack or stroke.






**Time to act**

* **Midodrine:** effects in **30–60 minutes**
* **Fludrocortisone:** effects in **hours–days**
  👉 **Act immediately** if symptoms appear. Do not wait.

**How to act**

1. **Stop the medicines**
2. **Check BP**
3. **Lay down, head slightly raised**
4. **No salt / no extra fluids**
5. **Go to emergency hospital**

**If heart stops**

* Yes, **CPR** works.
* Call emergency services.
* Start **CPR immediately**:

  * Hard surface
  * Chest compressions **100–120/min**
  * Depth **5–6 cm**
  * If trained: **30 compressions + 2 breaths**
  * Continue until help arrives

**Key**
Home care is limited. **Fast hospital care saves life.**





**CPR (Adult) — simple steps**

1. **Check response**
   Tap shoulders, shout.

2. **Call emergency help**
   Ask someone to call ambulance.

3. **Position**
   Lay on **hard, flat surface**. Kneel beside chest.

4. **Hand placement**
   Center of chest (between nipples).
   One hand over other, fingers locked.

5. **Compressions**

   * Push **hard & fast**
   * **100–120 per minute**
   * Depth **5–6 cm**
   * Let chest fully rise

6. **Breaths (if trained)**

   * **30 compressions + 2 breaths**
   * Head tilt, pinch nose, seal mouth

7. **If not trained**

   * **Hands-only CPR** (compressions only)

8. **Continue**
   Until ambulance arrives or person breathes.

⚠️ If an **AED** is available, use it immediately.





**Yes — it can be risky.**

If **not trained**:

* ❌ Do **NOT** give mouth-to-mouth
* ✔️ Do **hands-only CPR** (compressions only)

**Why risky**

* Infection risk
* Wrong breathing can push air into stomach
* Delays chest compressions

**Best rule**

* **Untrained → hands-only CPR**
* **Trained → 30 compressions + 2 breaths**

Chest compressions are the **most important** part.



**30 compressions + 2 breaths (trained person)**

1. **Open airway**
   Head tilt back, chin lift.

2. **Pinch nose**
   Close nostrils.

3. **Seal mouth**
   Your mouth fully over theirs.

4. **Give 1 breath**
   Blow **1 second** → chest rises.

5. **Give 2nd breath**
   Same way. Chest must rise.

6. **Resume compressions**
   Immediately do **30 compressions**.

🔁 Repeat **30 : 2** until help arrives or person breathes.

⚠️ If chest doesn’t rise → re-tilt head and try again.



**No. That will NOT work. ❌**

Correct CPR is **NOT** 5 presses.

**Correct method (adult):**

* **30 chest compressions**
* **Then 2 breaths**
* Repeat **30 : 2**

**Why 5 is wrong**

* Not enough blood flow to brain/heart
* Can cause death even if trying

**Rule to remember**

* Push **30 times**
* Breathe **2 times**
* Fast, hard, no long breaks

If unsure → **hands-only CPR** (compressions only) is safer and effective.





👉 **2 breaths → then 30 chest compressions**

Repeat:
**30 compressions + 2 breaths**
**30 compressions + 2 breaths**

If unsure, do **only chest compressions** continuously.
