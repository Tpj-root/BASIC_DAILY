**Question:**
In the wafer fabrication process, the photomask patterns are large. After UV light passes through the mask and a lens is placed below, how are these large patterns converted into nanoscale features on the wafer?


**Answer:**
The mask itself does not shrink. Instead, a **projection lens system** is used to **optically reduce (demagnify)** the mask pattern. UV light passes through or reflects from the photomask, and the high-precision lens projects a **reduced image (typically 4× or 5× smaller)** onto the photoresist-coated wafer. Using **short-wavelength UV light (DUV or EUV)** and lenses with **high numerical aperture**, the reduced image forms **nanoscale patterns** on the wafer.
